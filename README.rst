Brief Client Description
========================

Sweet Bs is a family bakery owned by The Benjamin's that sells various pastries. Currently, their method of collecting, organizing, and responding to orders is very inefficient and error-prone - requires too much manual entering of data and the method of ordering is very inconvenient for customers. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create a medium in which making orders is more seamless for the customers - your average person who is looking for pastries nearby or someone who already knows about the bakery - and collecting these orders and organizing them is less stressful for The Benjamins.
